### camel-spring-redis

The https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-{camel-version}/components/camel-spring-redis/src/main/docs/spring-redis-component.adoc[spring-redis,window=_blank] component allows sending and receiving messages from http://http//redis.io/[Redis,window=_blank]. Redis is advanced key-value store where keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets. In addition it provides pub/sub functionality for inter-app communications.

Camel provides a producer for executing commands, consumer for subscribing to pub/sub messages an idempotent repository for filtering out duplicate messages.
