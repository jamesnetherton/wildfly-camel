### camel-printer

The https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-{camel-version}/components/camel-printer/src/main/docs/printer-component.adoc[printer,window=_blank] component provides a way to direct payloads on a route to a printer. The objective is to be able to direct specific payloads as jobs to a line printer in a camel flow.
