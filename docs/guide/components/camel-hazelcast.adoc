### camel-hazelcast

The https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-{camel-version}/components/camel-hazelcast-component/src/main/docs/hazelcast-component-component.adoc[hazelcast,window=_blank] component allows you to work with the http://www.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast,window=_blank] distributed data grid/cache. Hazelcast is a in memory data grid, entirely written in Java (single jar). It offers a great palette of different data stores like map, multi map (same key, n values), queue, list and atomic number. The main reason to use Hazelcast is its simple cluster support.
