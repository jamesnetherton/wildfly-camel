### camel-jclouds

The https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-{camel-version}/components/camel-jclouds/src/main/docs/jclouds-component.adoc[camel-jclouds,window=_blank] component allows interaction with cloud provider key-value engines (blobstores) and compute services. The component uses http://code.google.com/p/jclouds[jclouds,window=_blank] which is
a library that provides abstractions for blobstores and compute services.

*ComputeService* simplifies the task of managing machines in the cloud. For example, you can use ComputeService to start 5 machines and install your software on them.

*BlobStore* simplifies dealing with key-value providers such as Amazon S3. For example, BlobStore can give you a simple Map view of a container.
